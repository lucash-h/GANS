This is a project to create a manifold guided GAN to evaluate the MNIST number dataset. 
In this case, an autoencoder to discriminator is accompanying a regular GAN to reduce
the chance of mode collapse. This architecture also allows for more diversified 
sampling possibilites.
# GAN - MNIST Digits
This is an implementation of a general adversarial network, that uses two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, to generate images that ressemble, in this case the MNSIT digit dataset. Working in tandem, the generator attempts to generate images to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator attempts to identify whether an image was generated by the generator or if it is a real image form the dataset.

## Generator
This neural network uses several layers, including convolutions, to generate images ressembling the given dataset.

## Discriminator
The discriminator neural network uses several layers to attempt to discern images created by the generator and images from the dataset

## Plotting metrics
There is a function in functions.py that is used to plot generator and discriminator loss, and accuracy.
These are kept track of in the loss log dictionary, where loss is updated for every batch in every epoch
while the accuracy is updated every epoch. 

## Running the project
### Downloading Dependencies
To run this project on your machine, it would be worth having an already set up IDE, otherwise using Colab would be easiest.
Navigate to the directory where you want the project to be located using cd
Within that directory, create a new folder for the project using mkdir project_folder_name
Navigate to the new folder using cd project_folder_name
Initialize a git repo using git init
Run git clone https://github.com/lucash-h/MNIST_GAN
Navigate to cloned repo directory using cd MNIST_GAN
Check the dependencies needed using cat requirements.txt 
pip install -r requirement.txt to download all dependencies

To run the project, simply type python main.py

### Using Google Colab
Google colab can be used to run it without
