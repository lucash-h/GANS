# GAN - MNIST Digits
This is an implementation of a general adversarial network, that uses two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, to generate images that ressemble, in this case the MNSIT digit dataset. Working in tandem, the generator attempts to generate images to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator attempts to identify whether an image was generated by the generator or if it is a real image form the dataset.

## Generator
This neural network uses several layers, including convolutions, to generate images ressembling the given dataset.

## Discriminator
The discriminator neural network uses several layers to attempt to discern images created by the generator and images from the dataset

## Plotting metrics
There is a function in functions.py that is used to plot generator and discriminator loss, and accuracy.
These are kept track of in the loss log dictionary, where loss is updated for every batch in every epoch
while the accuracy is updated every epoch. 

## Running the Project in Google Colab
1. Navigate to the `GAN.ipynb` file.
2. Click on the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the file.
3. Ensure that the runtime type is set to Python 3 by clicking on the "Runtime" menu, then "Change runtime type", and selecting "Python 3".
4. if available, change Hardware accelerator to T4 GPU, or a different option as CPU is not fast
5. Run the entire notebook by clicking on the "Runtime" menu and selecting "Run all". Alternatively, run each cell individually by clicking on the play button to the left of each cell.

## Running the project (IDE) - NOT WORKING
To run this project on your machine, it would be worth having an already set up IDE, otherwise using Colab would be easiest.
Navigate to the directory where you want the project to be located using cd
Within that directory, create a new folder for the project using mkdir project_folder_name
Navigate to the new folder using cd project_folder_name
Initialize a git repo using git init
Run git clone https://github.com/lucash-h/MNIST_GAN
Navigate to cloned repo directory using cd MNIST_GAN
Check the dependencies needed using cat requirements.txt 
pip install -r requirement.txt to download all dependencies
or pip install "specific dependency"

To run the project type
set PYTHONENCODING=utf-8 followed by python MyGan.py
